# Tableau-Superstore-Sales-Dashboard

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard created using Tableau Public Desktop, analyzing sales data from the "Sample - Superstore Sales" dataset. The dashboard includes interactive features to allow users to explore segment-specific insights dynamically.

---

## Overview

The dashboard provides insights into:
1. **Profit by Segment:** A graphical representation of profit distribution across segments with an interactive filter.
2. **Business Insights Table:** A table summarizing profit, quantity, and sales for each segment, dynamically updated based on the selected segment.
3. **Statewise Profit:** A graph showing profit distribution across all states, which also changes dynamically based on the selected segment.

## Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Segment Filter:** The "Profit by Segment" graph acts as a filter, allowing users to click on a segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, or Home Office). The other components of the dashboard (Business Insights Table and Statewise Profit graph) update dynamically to reflect the selected segment.
- **Dynamic Insights:** Quickly explore data trends by focusing on specific segments and observing how profit, sales, and quantity vary across states.
